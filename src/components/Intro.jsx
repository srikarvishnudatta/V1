        <p>Hi, my name is</p>
        <h1>Srikar Akella</h1>
        <h1>I am a Software Developer.</h1>
        <p>I'm a Masters of Applied Computer Science student at Concordia University, Montreal, Canada. 
            I love to build websites, play video games, practice violin and often hit the gym. This year I want to learn kickboxing/MMA. 
            I am a foodie and love coffee, and write down all my thoughts about the restaurant/cafe I visited. I have to make a website which has all of my recipes and my honest reviews about the places I visited.
